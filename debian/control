Description: GTP Guard: GPRS Tunneling Protocol Routing software
 GTP-Guard is a routing software written in C. The main goal of this project
 is to provide robust and secure extensions to GTP protocol (GPRS Tunneling
 Protocol). GTP is widely used for data-plane in mobile core-network. GTP-Guard
 implements a set of 3 main framworks. The first one offers a Proxy feature for
 data-plane tweaking. The second one is a Routing facility to inter-connect,
 encapsulates or provides any routing related. The last one is a Firewall
 feature offering filtering, rewriting, redirecting. GTP-Guard relies on Linux
 Kernel XDP framework for its data-plane using eBPF programs. Administration
 and user-level interface are available via a standard VTY terminal interface.
