# Soft:        The main goal of gtp-guard is to provide robust and secure
#              extensions to GTP protocol (GPRS Tunneling Procol). GTP is
#              widely used for data-plane in mobile core-network. gtp-guard
#              implements a set of 3 main frameworks:
#              A Proxy feature for data-plane tweaking, a Routing facility
#              to inter-connect and a Firewall feature for filtering,
#              rewriting and redirecting.
