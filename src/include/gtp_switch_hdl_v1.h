 * Soft:        The main goal of gtp-guard is to provide robust and secure
 *              extensions to GTP protocol (GPRS Tunneling Procol). GTP is
 *              widely used for data-plane in mobile core-network. gtp-guard
 *              implements a set of 3 main frameworks:
 *              A Proxy feature for data-plane tweaking, a Routing facility
 *              to inter-connect and a Firewall feature for filtering,
 *              rewriting and redirecting.
